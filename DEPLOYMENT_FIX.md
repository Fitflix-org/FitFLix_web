# Render Deployment Fix

## Issues Fixed:
1. Changed from `web` service to `static_site` in render.yaml
2. Proper static file serving configuration
3. Ensured _redirects file is included in build
4. Added production build script

## Updated Files:
- `render.yaml` - Changed to static_site deployment
- `vite.config.ts` - Added explicit outDir and assetsDir
- `package.json` - Added build:prod script

## Deployment Instructions:

1. Push these changes to your GitHub repository:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Render deployment - switch to static site"
git push origin main
```

2. In Render Dashboard:
   - Go to your service settings
   - Update the service type to "Static Site" if needed
   - Ensure build command is: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Ensure publish directory is: `./dist`

3. Redeploy the service

## What this fixes:
- ✅ 403 Forbidden errors on static assets
- ✅ Manifest.json loading issues  
- ✅ PWA functionality
- ✅ Client-side routing with React Router
- ✅ Proper favicon and logo serving

The site will now deploy as a proper static site instead of trying to run a Node.js server.
